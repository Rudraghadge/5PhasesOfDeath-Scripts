## 🧠 About the Game
Each phase of the game reveals the inner trauma of a real person, inspired by psychological struggles that manifest as horror.  
Instead of relying on jump scares, the focus is on **emotional horror** — moments that make players question their reality and choices.  

Players experience a first-person perspective where sound, light, and interaction blend to tell a silent story.  
Every detail — a creak, a whisper, a flickering light — carries meaning.
